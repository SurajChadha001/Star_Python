# Recursive Star Pattern with Turtle Graphics

This repository contains a Python script that uses the `turtle` module to draw a recursive star pattern, creating a fractal-like structure on a black background with yellow stars.

## Description
The script initializes a turtle object and uses recursion to draw a series of interconnected stars. The pattern starts with a large star and recursively draws smaller stars at each point, resulting in a tree-like fractal design. The background is set to black, and the stars are drawn in yellow for contrast.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `turtle` module (included with standard Python installation)

## Installation
No additional installation is required beyond Python. Simply clone or download the repository and run the script.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
python star_pattern.py
